                        Just after my husband I were married in 2010 he took a short-term
                        position in Germany. From that central location we traveled (and ate!)
                        all over Europe. We called it our last "hoorah" before the baby years
                        and returned to The States to settle in and have that first life
                        altering baby. One thing I learned from ordering food in many other 
                        countries is that you may think you know what you ordered and what 
                        food to expect, but chances are, you don't have any idea.
