                            Just after my husband I were married in 2010 he took a short-term
                            position in Germany. From that central location, we traveled (and ate!)
                            all over Europe. We called it our last "hoorah" before returning to the 
                            states to settle in for our first life altering baby. One thing I learned 
                            from ordering food in foreign countries is that you may think you know what
                            you ordered and what food to expect, but chances are, you don't have any idea.
